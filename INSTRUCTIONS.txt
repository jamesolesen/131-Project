**********************************INSTRUCTIONS********************************
The Team S&B Movie Interface Software Service is a program designed to return
information regarding Oscar winners for Best Picture. This is accomplished
through a REST service that returns JSON objects containing the information
for relevant movies.

The following are all of the possible functions for the program. 
Each are accessible by entering the following commands.

1) localhost:8080/movies/bestMovies

This returns a collection of all of the winners of Best Picture, in which 
the Title, Year, and collection ID are returned.

2) localhost:8080/movies/bestMovie?year=_____

A 4-digit year must be placed in the blank space above. This returns a singleton
for the winner of Best Movie for the year entered, in which 
the Title, Year, and collection ID are returned. This works only for 
numeric entries between 1962 and 2017 inclusive. Other entries will return
a blank movie entry, showing no title, year, or ID. 

3) localhost:8080/movies/bestMovie/_______

A 4-digit year must be placed in the blank space above. This returns a singleton
for the winner of Best Movie for the year entered, in which 
the Title, Year, and collection ID are returned. This works only for 
numeric entries between 1962 and 2017 inclusive. Other entries will return 
a blank movie entry, showing no title, year, or ID. 

4) localhost:8080/movies/allBestMovieNominees

This returns a collection of all of the nominees for Best Picture ever.
These will be in order of ID, which groups all years together. 
The Title, Year, and collection ID are returned for each object.

5) localhost:8080/movies/bestMovieNominees/____

A 4-digit year must be placed in the blank space above. This returns 
a collection of all of the Best Picture nominees for the year entered,
in which the Title, Year, and ID are returned. This works only for
numeric entries between 1962 and 2017 inclusive. Other entries will return
a single, blank movie object.
